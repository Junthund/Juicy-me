# Juicy me (Junthund's City-like Map Editor) v0.1

This tool allows you to draw and edit orthogonal maps placing rectangular 
elements (called components) on a canvas.

In this version, you can import and export maps as JSON files, only to save
and edit maps already generated. But there's always a "Print screen" button
to make an image out of the map.

Please contact me if you want to contribute or suggest changes:

Of couse, you can also make an issue.
